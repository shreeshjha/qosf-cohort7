This program is a quantum circuit implementation to compare two numbers using the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm. The user is prompted to enter two numbers, and the program then determines which of the two is larger. The algorithm uses a quantum circuit to perform this task by encoding the two numbers into the quantum state of qubits, and then using a phase estimation routine to determine the relative phase between the two numbers. Finally, a measurement is made to obtain the result
